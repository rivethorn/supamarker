SUPAMARKER
----------

A bispoke CLI tool for adding and removing Markdown files to and from a Supabase bucket.
I use it for my blog site, you can use it for whatever.

Notice:
    *Still heavily in development.*

TODO:
    - Add loading indicator
    - Add listing ability to see the items, and where they are (table, bucket, both)
    - Add --soft flag to remove the row from DB but keep the file in bucket
    - Ask for confirmation to delete, after the presence is verified
